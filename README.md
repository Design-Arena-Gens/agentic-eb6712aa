# Nexari Labs â€” AI Automation & IT Solutions Agency

Enterprise-grade marketing site built with Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Three.js, and Framer Motion. The experience is tuned for premium, futuristic storytelling with a dark/light theme system, rich motion, and an interactive 3D hero.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- Four fully responsive pages: Home, Services, About, Contact
- Advanced Three.js hero animation rendered with `@react-three/fiber`
- Global dark/light theming powered by `next-themes`
- Modular sections & shared layout primitives (e.g., `Container`, `Button`, `ThemeToggle`)
- Style tokens defined in `app/src/styles/tokens.ts` and consumed via utility helpers
- Framer Motion micro-interactions across navigation, cards, and content reveals
- Production build verified with `npm run build`

npm install
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## ðŸ§± Production Build
```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```
Both commands must succeed before deployment. The project targets Vercel; a production deployment command is provided below.

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment
After verifying the production build, deploy with Vercel (requires `VERCEL_TOKEN`):
```bash
vercel deploy --prod --yes --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --name agentic-eb6712aa
